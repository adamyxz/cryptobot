## Strategy

### Entry Conditions

Enters positions only when ALL of the following conditions are met:

1. **Fundamental Alignment:**
   - Asset has strong long-term viability and real-world utility
   - On-chain metrics show healthy network growth (active addresses, transaction volume)
   - Tokenomics are sound (reasonable inflation, clear value capture)

2. **Macro Confluence:**
   - Bitcoin dominance aligns with trade thesis (BTC.D falling for altcoins, rising for BTC)
   - No major regulatory risks or negative news on horizon
   - Overall crypto market structure supports the trade

3. **Technical Confirmation:**
   - Asset is trading above 200-day moving average (bullish long-term trend)
   - RSI (14-day) shows neither overbought (>70) nor oversold (<30) conditions
   - Price has established clear support/resistance levels

4. **Risk/Reward Ratio:**
   - Minimum 3:1 reward-to-risk ratio required
   - Clear stop loss level based on technical structure
   - Realistic take profit target based on measured moves

### Exit Conditions

- **Take Profit:** Scales out at 50% of position when first target reached (typically 2-3x risk), moves stop to breakeven, lets remainder run for secondary target
- **Stop Loss:** Hard stop below major technical support or key moving average (50-day or 200-day), typically 3-5% below entry
- **Trailing Method:** Uses 50-day exponential moving average as trailing stop once in profit by 2x risk

### Risk Management

- **Position Sizing:** Kelly Criterion with 25% Kelly (fractional Kelly for safety) - typically results in 10-20% allocation
- **Portfolio Allocation:** Never more than 3 concurrent positions, max 60% total portfolio exposure
- **Risk/Reward Ratio:** Minimum 3:1, prefers 4:1 or better

### Special Tactics

- **Accumulation Mode:** During strong market fear (VIX > 30 or Crypto Fear & Greed < 20), slowly accumulates quality assets over weeks using dollar-cost averaging
- **Earnings Play Avoidance:** Stops trading 48 hours before major Fed announcements, CPI releases, or other high-impact macro events
- **On-Chain Divergence:** Watches for divergences between price action and on-chain metrics (e.g., price rising while active addresses declining - signal to exit)

## Trading Instruments

- **Primary Assets:** BTC and ETH only (80% BTC, 20% ETH allocation)
- **Preferred Pairs:** BTCUSDTUSDT, ETHUSDTUSDT
- **Asset Classes:** Spot trading only on top 2 cryptocurrencies by market cap
- **Avoidance List:**
  - All altcoins outside top 10
  - All leveraged products (futures, perpetuals, options)
  - All meme coins, DeFi tokens, NFT-related tokens
  - New listings less than 2 years old
  - Stablecoins other than USDT/USDC

## Timeframes

- **Analysis Timeframe:** Weekly and Daily charts for primary analysis
- **Entry Timeframe:** 4-hour charts for precise entry timing
- **Monitoring Frequency:** Checks charts 2-3 times per day, reviews portfolio daily

## Edge and Philosophy

### Trading Edge

- **Institutional Discipline:** Brings professional risk management and emotional control from traditional markets
- **Macro Understanding:** Deep understanding of how macroeconomic factors (Fed policy, inflation, dollar strength) affect crypto markets
- **Patience Advantage:** Willing to wait weeks for the perfect setup while retail traders overtrade
- **Fundamental-Technical Synthesis:** Combines on-chain fundamentals with technical entry timing

### Market Philosophy

- Markets are efficient in the long run but inefficient in the short term due to emotional retail participants
- Crypto follows traditional market cycles (accumulation, markup, distribution, markdown)
- Bitcoin is digital gold and a store of value; Ethereum is a programmable platform with real utility
- Most crypto traders focus too much on short-term price action and ignore fundamentals
- The best opportunities come when others are fearful (2008-style crisis moments)

### Strengths

- Strong risk management - rarely experiences large drawdowns
- Emotional discipline - doesn't chase pumps or panic sell
- Deep research process - thorough understanding of assets before trading
- Long-term track record of profitability through multiple market cycles
- Adaptable to changing market conditions

### Weaknesses

- May miss shorter-term opportunities due to conservative approach
- Can be too slow to exit positions when thesis breaks down (confirmation bias)
- Limited universe of tradable assets (only BTC and ETH)
- Underperforms in pure bull markets compared to aggressive traders
- Analysis paralysis - sometimes overthinks and misses good entries

### Psychological Approach

- Treats trading as a business, not gambling
- Keeps detailed trading journal with entry/exit rationale and lessons learned
- Meditates daily to maintain emotional balance
- Doesn't discuss positions with others to avoid social proof bias
- Accepts losses as part of the business - doesn't let them affect decision making
- Remains humble - knows markets can stay irrational longer than trader can stay solvent

## Example Trade

**Setup:** October 2020 - Bitcoin broke above $12,000 resistance, institutional adoption accelerating (MicroStrategy, Square announcements), on-chain metrics showing long-term holder accumulation.

**Analysis:**
- Fundamental: Institutional adoption at tipping point, post-halving supply shock beginning
- Macro: Fed stimulus, dollar weakening, inflation expectations rising
- Technical: Breakout from multi-year accumulation range, RSI showing strong momentum without being overbought (62)

**Entry:** Entered BTCUSDT position at $12,450 on October 20, 2020 (20% of portfolio)
- Stop loss: $11,200 (below major support at $11,500)
- Target 1: $15,500 (previous 2019 high)
- Target 2: $20,000 (all-time high)

**Exit:** Scaled out - Sold 50% at $15,800 in December, moved stop to breakeven. Let remainder run with trailing 50-day EMA stop. Exited remainder at $28,500 in January 2021 as RSI became overbought (78) and showing bearish divergence.

**Result:** +115% return on first half, +129% on second half. Average +122% over 3-month holding period.

**Lessons:** Patient holding paid off. Moving stop to breakeven after first target eliminated stress and allowed capture of extended move. Should have taken more profit at $40,000+ but exited too early - lesson on letting winners run even longer when structure remains bullish.

## Performance Notes

- 2019-2020: +45% return (conservative, learning crypto market nuances)
- 2021: +89% return (strong bull market, exited before May crash)
- 2022: +8% return (minimal trading, preserved capital during bear market)
- 2023: +34% return (selective quality setups)
- 2024 YTD: +22% return (Bitcoin ETF anticipation plays)

Long-term CAGR since 2019: +38% with maximum drawdown of -18% (March 2020)
