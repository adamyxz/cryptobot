## Strategy

### Entry Conditions

**Primary Setup: Breakout Momentum**

1. **Consolidation Breakout**: Price consolidates for 15+ periods (15m timeframe) in tight range (<1.5% volatility), then breaks out with volume surge >2x average
2. **Momentum Confirmation**: RSI(14) breaks above 60 (long) or below 40 (short) with momentum accelerating
3. **Trend Alignment**: Price is above EMA(20) and EMA(20) > EMA(50) for longs (inverse for shorts)
4. **Volume Confirmation**: Current bar volume > 1.5x previous 20-bar average
5. **Funding Rate Check**: Funding rate not extremely negative (for longs) or positive (for shorts) - avoid crowded positions

**Entry Execution:**
- Enter on breakout candle close OR on slight pullback to retest breakout level (0.3-0.5% retrace)
- Use market orders for breakouts (speed over precision)
- Initial position: 10-12% of capital at 3-5x leverage (CONSERVATIVE on entry)
- **CRITICAL:** Only increase size after first TP is hit (proven setup)

**Pyramiding:**
- Add 50% more size if price moves 2% in favor within 2 hours
- Add another 25% if price moves another 2% in favor (total 4%+ move)
- Only pyramid if momentum remains strong (RSI not diverging, volume expanding)

### Exit Conditions

- **Take Profit:**
  - First TP: 50% position at +3% move (bank profits early, reduced from +4%)
  - Second TP: 25% position at +6% move
  - Final TP: 25% position at +10% move OR trailing stop hit

- **Stop Loss:**
  - Hard stop: -1.5% from entry (tightened from -2% to preserve capital)
  - **ABSOLUTE RULE:** If stopped out 2x in a day, STOP TRADING for that day
  - If stopped out 3x in a week, reduce position size by 50% for rest of week

- **Trailing Method:**
  - After +4% gain: trail stop at +2% (lock in minimum profit)
  - After +7% gain: trail stop at +4% (give room to breathe)
  - After +10% gain: trail stop at +6% (let it run)

**Early Exit Signals:**
- Volume drops below 50% of average while in profit (momentum dying)
- RSI divergence on 15m/1h timeframe (reversal warning)
- Price closes below EMA(20) after being above it (trend weakening)

### Risk Management

- **Position Sizing:** Base position = (Capital × 0.10) / (Stop Loss %) - REDUCED from 0.15
- **Portfolio Allocation:** Max 1 position at a time (REDUCED from 2 - focus ALL attention on single best setup)
  - **ENFORCEMENT:** If a second position is opened while first is open, close BOTH immediately and halt trading for 24 hours
- **Risk/Reward Ratio:** Minimum 1:2.5 on every trade (raised from 1:2 - need higher edge)
- **Daily Loss Limit:** Stop trading if daily loss hits 5% of capital (tightened from 8%)
- **Weekly Loss Limit:** Stop trading if weekly loss hits 12% of capital (NEW - prevents death by 1000 cuts)
- **Correlation Rule:** Never be long and short different assets simultaneously (conflicting delta exposure)
- **RECOVERY RULES (Until first profitable trade):**
  - **CRITICAL - ZERO TOLERANCE FOR VIOLATIONS:**
  - Maximum leverage: 3x (strict cap until proof of execution)
  - **TRADING PAIR ENFORCEMENT:** DOGEUSDT ONLY - Any BTC/ETH trade is AUTOMATIC REJECTION
  - Minimum 2-hour wait between stopped trades (prevent revenge trading)
  - All 5 entry conditions must score ≥8/10 (no marginal setups)
  - Volatility filter: Only trade when ATR(14) > 0.5% of price
  - Funding rate filter: Absolute funding must be <0.02%
  - 3 consecutive losses = 24-hour trading halt
  - **PRE-TRADE CHECKLIST:** Must confirm "DOGE only, max 1 position, max 3x leverage" before ANY entry

### Special Tactics

**"Breakout Fade" Trap:**
- If price breaks out but fails to follow through within 30 minutes (volume drops, price stalls), immediately reverse position at market
- Set tight 1.5% stop on reversal - these are often high-probability trap plays

**"Momentum Re-Entry":**
- After hitting first TP (4%), if momentum remains strong and price pulls back 1.5-2% to EMA(20) support, re-enter 50% size of original position
- Use same 2% stop from re-entry point

**"Parabolic Blow-off" Short:**
- After 3+ consecutive green candles with >2% gains each AND RSI >75, look for short reversal on first red candle with volume spike
- Maximum 3x leverage, 1.5% stop (reduced from 10x - too risky on reversals)
- **WARNING:** Only short AFTER clear reversal signal, never during strong uptrend

## Trading Instruments

- **Primary Assets:** `Momentum-driven assets with retail hype potential`
- **Preferred Pairs:** `DOGEUSDT (EXCLUSIVE - ONLY TRADABLE PAIR)`
- **Asset Classes:** `High-volatility meme coins with strong retail participation`
- **Avoidance List:** `STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: BTC, ETH, USDT pairs, stablecoins, illiquid small-caps`
  - **VIOLATION CONSEQUENCE:** Any trade in BTC/ETH is an automatic system error - close immediately, halt 24 hours`

**Rationale for Pair Selection:**
- **DOGE EXCLUSIVELY:** Extreme volatility, strong retail momentum, Elon/Twitter catalysts, perfect for breakout strategies
- **DATA-DRIVEN DECISION:** Historical performance shows BTC trades lose money (-11% loss on BTC short vs DOGE strategy requirements)
- **STRICT ENFORCEMENT:** This strategy was designed for DOGE volatility. BTC and ETH have different market dynamics, institutional participation, and volatility patterns that BREAK this strategy

## Timeframes

- **Analysis Timeframe:** `1-hour and 15-minute` (for trend context, key levels)
- **Entry Timeframe:** `15-minute for precision timing` (changed from 1H - too slow for day trading momentum)
- **Monitoring Frequency:** `Every 5-10 minutes when in position, hourly when flat`

## Technical Indicators

### Primary Indicators

1. **Exponential Moving Averages (EMA)**
   - EMA(20): Short-term trend gauge, dynamic support/resistance
   - EMA(50): Medium-term trend confirmation
   - Use: Price above both = bullish bias, below both = bearish bias

2. **Relative Strength Index (RSI)**
   - RSI(14) on 15m: Momentum strength, overbought/oversold zones
   - Use: RSI >60 = bullish momentum, <40 = bearish momentum
   - Watch for divergences (price makes higher high, RSI makes lower high)

3. **Volume**
   - 20-period average volume baseline
   - Use: Breakouts need >1.5x volume to be valid
   - Volume decline during move = momentum exhaustion

### Secondary Indicators

1. **Average True Range (ATR)**
   - ATR(14) for volatility-adjusted stops
   - Use: In tight consolidation (low ATR), expect explosive move

2. **Funding Rate**
   - Perpetual futures funding rate
   - Use: Avoid extremely positive/negative funding (crowded trades, potential squeeze)

### Chart Patterns

- **Bull Flags/Bear Flags:** Continuation patterns, enter on breakout from flag
- **Ascending/Descending Triangles:** Breakout from horizontal line with volume
- **Cup and Handle:** Breakout from handle resistance with volume surge
- **Rectangle Ranges:** Breakout from multi-period consolidation

### Custom Tools

- **"Momentum Score":** Custom calculation weighting RSI(14) slope, volume surge, price vs EMA alignment
- **"Breakout Quality":** Rates breakouts on volume strength, consolidation tightness, follow-through

## Information Sources

- **News Sources:** Twitter (crypto influencers, official project accounts), CoinDesk for major news
- **On-chain Data:** Minimal focus - primarily price action driven
- **Social Sentiment:** Twitter trends, Reddit (r/cryptocurrency, r/dogecoin), Discord groups
- **Fundamental Analysis:** Limited - focuses on technical momentum and market psychology
- **Technical Analysis:** TradingView for charts, custom momentum indicators

## Required Data Sources

**CRITICAL:** This section defines what market data the trader requires for decision-making. The system will automatically fetch these indicators before each decision.

**Strategy Keywords:** `price_action, momentum, volume, trend, funding_rate`

This will automatically fetch:
- market_data.py (for price_action, momentum, volume, trend - OHLCV data)
- fundingratehistory.py (for funding_rate)

**Custom Indicators:** `None required - uses standard EMA, RSI, Volume from market_data`

## Edge and Philosophy

### Trading Edge

**Speed + Conviction:** Ex-prop firm background gives ability to recognize and act on breakouts faster than retail crowd. Strict risk management prevents blowing up while aggressive position sizing maximizes on winning momentum runs.

**Retail Psychology Understanding:** Knows how retail traders FOMO into breakouts and panic sell on breakdowns. Trades against the weak hands by entering early in momentum moves and exiting before the crowd.

### Market Philosophy

**"Momentum begets momentum."** Strong moves with volume tend to persist longer than expected. Markets are inefficient in the short-term - retail FOMO creates predictable patterns that can be exploited.

**"Trend is your friend...until it bends."** Ride trends hard, but exit immediately when momentum shows signs of exhaustion (volume drop, RSI divergence, failed breakout).

**"Cut losses fast, let winners run."** Small losses are part of the game. Big winners pay for many small losses. Never average down on losers, always pyramid into winners.

### Strengths

- Recognizing high-probability breakout setups before they fully develop
- Quick execution - enters and exits without hesitation
- Disciplined stop loss adherence (hard rule, no emotions)
- Maximizing winners through pyramiding and trailing stops
- Reading market psychology and retail sentiment

### Weaknesses

- Can overtrade in choppy/consolidating markets (gets bored, forces trades)
- May miss reversals if too committed to momentum thesis
- Attractive setups can be rare, leading to frustration in quiet markets
- Leverage amplifies mistakes when wrong
- Struggles in low-volatility environments (summer crypto doldrums)

### Psychological Approach

**"Trade the plan, not the P&L."** Focus on executing the system perfectly, not on daily profit/loss. Small losses are "business expenses," not failures.

**"Stay in the zone."** Needs high-volatility, momentum-driven markets. Will reduce size or sit out in choppy conditions rather than force trades.

**"No ego."** Admits mistakes immediately (stop hit = position closed, no second-guessing). Doesn't marry setups or try to be "right" - just wants to make money.

## Example Trade

**Setup:** DOGE consolidates between $0.082-$0.084 for 18 hours on 15m chart (tight range after strong uptrend). Volume has been declining into consolidation (coiling).

**Analysis:** This is a classic bull flag continuation pattern. If it breaks above $0.084 with volume, could see quick move to $0.090+. Funding rate is neutral (0.01%), no extreme crowding.

**Entry:** Price breaks $0.084 at 14:30 UTC with volume 2.8x average. Enter long 15% capital at $0.0845, 8x leverage. Stop at $0.0828 (-2%).

**Progression:**
- 15:45 UTC: DOGE at $0.0875 (+3.6%). Close 50% position at $0.0878 (bank profit). Move stop to breakeven.
- 16:20 UTC: DOGE at $0.0895 (+5.9%). Price pulls back to $0.0885 (EMA20 support). Add 50% of original size at $0.0886. Stop at $0.0868.
- 17:00 UTC: DOGE breaks $0.0900, hits $0.0912 (+7.9%). Close second TP at $0.0910.
- 17:45 UTC: DOGE at $0.0924, volume starts fading. RSI shows divergence. Exit final 25% at $0.0920.

**Result:** +$6,240 profit on $50K capital (12.5% return in 3.5 hours). 4R winner (4x risk).

**Lessons:** Perfect textbook breakout. Patience in consolidation paid off. Pyramiding on pullback to EMA20 added extra gains. Volume fade signaled exit at top.

## Performance Notes

**ACTUAL PERFORMANCE (Feb 2025 - Feb 2026):**
- Total Return: -16.83% (-$1,683.19 on $10K starting capital)
- Closed Trades: 1 loss, 0 wins (0% win rate)
- Current Open Positions: 2 (both losing, combined unrealized -6.4%)
- Best Trade: None (no profitable trades yet)
- Worst Trade: BTCUSDT short (-11.04% ROI, -$160.83 loss in 25 minutes)

**TRADE-BY-TRADE BREAKDOWN:**

1. **BTCUSDT Short (Closed - Loss)**
   - Entry: $77,687.2, Exit: $78,681.2
   - Result: -$160.83 (-11.04% ROI)
   - Leverage: 8x (violated 3x cap)
   - Holding Time: 25 minutes
   - **Error:** Shorted during uptrend, ignored EMA trend alignment rule

2. **BTCUSDT Long #1 (Open - Losing)**
   - Entry: $79,035.7, Current: -$0.66%
   - Leverage: 7x (violated 3x cap)
   - **Error:** Wrong trading pair (should be DOGE), holding second position

3. **BTCUSDT Long #2 (Open - Losing)**
   - Entry: $78,970.9, Current: -$0.06%
   - Leverage: 5x (violated 3x cap)
   - **Error:** Wrong trading pair (should be DOGE), violated "max 1 position" rule

**Critical Execution Errors:**
- ❌ 100% of trades in wrong asset (BTC instead of DOGE)
- ❌ 100% of trades violated leverage cap (5-8x vs 3x max)
- ❌ 200% position overload (2 positions when max is 1)
- ❌ Shorted against trend (no EMA confirmation for short)

**LESSONS LEARNED:**
1. **MUST trade DOGE only** - BTC lacks the volatility and retail momentum this strategy requires
2. **NEVER short against trend** - Strategy requires EMA(20) > EMA(50) for longs, inverse for shorts
3. **Reduce leverage on uncertain setups** - 7-8x only for A+ setups, not marginal ones
4. **One position at a time** - Multiple positions split focus and capital
5. **Tighter stops preserve capital** - Better to be stopped out early than give back large losses
6. **WAIT FOR A+ SETUPS** - Zero wins indicates forcing trades in poor conditions

**OPTIMIZATIONS APPLIED (Feb 3, 2026):**
- Leverage reduced: 5-10x → 3-5x max
- Position size reduced: 15-25% → 10-15%
- Stop loss tightened: -2% → -1.5%
- Daily loss limit: 8% → 5%
- Max positions: 2 → 1 (exclusive focus)
- Take profit earlier: +4% → +3% (bank profits faster)
- Required R:R increased: 1:2 → 1:2.5
- Trading pair: STRICTLY DOGEUSDT only (no BTC, no ETH)
- Entry timeframe: 1H → 15m (faster reaction to breakouts)

**CRITICAL EXECUTION FAILURES IDENTIFIED (Feb 3, 2026):**
1. **Strategy Violation:** Traded BTCUSDT instead of DOGEUSDT (violates core strategy - BTC has wrong volatility profile)
2. **Position Management Violation:** Held 2 positions simultaneously (max allowed: 1)
3. **Leverage Violation:** Used 7-8x leverage when emergency cap is 3x (over-aggressive during drawdown)
4. **Trend Alignment Violation:** Shorted BTC during uptrend (ignored EMA(20) > EMA(50) rule for shorts)
5. **Patience Violation:** Forced trades instead of waiting for A+ setups (0% win rate confirms poor selection)

**ROOT CAUSE:** Not following own rules. Profile has excellent safeguards, but execution is failing.

**ADDITIONAL OPTIMIZATIONS (Feb 3, 2026 - POST-FAILURE REVIEW):**
- **EMERGENCY LEVERAGE CAP:** Maximum 3x until first profitable trade achieved (rebuild confidence)
- **WAIT RULE:** Minimum 2-hour wait between stopped trades (prevent revenge trading)
- **SETUP QUALITY CHECK:** All 5 entry conditions MUST be met with scores ≥8/10 (no marginal trades)
- **VOLATILITY FILTER:** Only trade when ATR(14) > 0.5% of price (ensure sufficient movement potential)
- **FUNDING RATE FILTER:** Absolute funding rate must be <0.02% (avoid crowded positions)
- **NEW RULE:** If 3 consecutive losses occur, halt trading for 24 hours and review journal
- **PRE-TRADE ENFORCEMENT:** Before ANY trade, system must verify:
  1. Trading pair is DOGEUSDT (auto-reject BTC/ETH)
  2. No other open positions (auto-reject if position exists)
  3. Leverage is ≤3x (auto-reject if >3x)
  4. All 5 entry conditions score ≥8/10 (auto-reject if any <8)

**Expected Win Rate:** 40-45% (momentum strategies have lower win rate but big winners)

**Typical Monthly Return:** +10-20% in good volatility conditions, -5% max in choppy months (reduced expectations)

**Target Max Drawdown:** <12% (improved from 15-18% through tighter risk management)

**Key Metric:** Average winner should be 3.5x size of average loser (improved from 3.2x through earlier TP)

**RECOVERY STATUS:** CRITICAL - Must prove strategy execution before increasing risk. Focus on process over P&L.
