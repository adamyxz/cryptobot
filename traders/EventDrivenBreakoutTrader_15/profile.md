## Strategy

### Entry Conditions

**Long Entries:**
- Major positive catalysts (exchange listings, protocol upgrades, partnerships, ETF approvals)
- Price breaks above key resistance with volume surge 2x+ average
- Positive funding rate alignment (longs paying shorts = bullish momentum)
- Social sentiment spike (Twitter/X mentions, Telegram activity)
- Enters on breakout confirmation or slight pullback to broken resistance (now support)

**Short Entries:**
- "Buy the rumor, sell the news" events (news is priced in, selling on announcement)
- Failed breakouts at key levels (fakeout patterns)
- Negative catalysts (regulatory FUD, security issues, delistings)
- Funding rates extremely positive (crowded longs = potential squeeze downside)

**Entry Timing:**
- Pre-event: Small position 1-2 hours before major announcements (if leak/anticipation clear)
- Post-event: Aggressive entry on confirmed breakout direction
- Scales in: 50% initial, adds 50% on momentum confirmation

### Exit Conditions

- **Take Profit:**
  - Quick flip: +15-25% on initial momentum spike (first 2-6 hours)
  - Swing trade: +40-80% on multi-day follow-through
  - Partial exits at 2x risk, trail stop on remainder

- **Stop Loss:**
  - Event failure: -10% if catalyst doesn't produce expected volatility
  - Fakeout breakout: -8% if price falls back below breakout level
  - Hard stop: -15% maximum per position

- **Trailing:**
  - Uses 15-minute ATR trailing stop (2x ATR below peak after initial profit)
  - Exits on volume exhaustion (declining volume on new highs)

### Risk Management

- **Position Sizing:**
  - Base position: 25% of portfolio
  - High conviction: 35% (clear catalyst + clean setup + favorable funding)
  - Scales out: 50% at first target, 50% on runner

- **Portfolio Allocation:**
  - 1-2 concurrent event positions maximum
  - Keeps 40-50% cash waiting for next catalyst
  - Doesn't force trades when no clear events

- **Risk/Reward:**
  - Minimum 1:2 on initial entry
  - Targets 1:5+ on home-run catalyst trades

### Special Tactics

**Pre-Event Positioning:**
- Takes small directional bets 1-2 hours before major scheduled events (earnings, Fed, CPI)
- Uses tight stops (-8%) because binary outcome

**Post-Event Momentum Capture:**
- Waits for initial 5-15 minute reaction, then enters direction of momentum
- Avoids being front-run by algorithms - lets price establish direction

**Fakeout Fade Strategy:**
- Shorts failed breakouts above key levels that immediately reverse
- Covers at support levels for quick 10-15% gains

**Funding Rate Analysis:**
- High positive funding = crowded longs (potential short on news disappointment)
- Negative funding = crowded shorts (potential long squeeze on positive news)

## Instruments

- **Primary Assets:** `Binance Coin (BNB)`, `Bitcoin (BTC)`
- **Preferred Pairs:** ``Binance Coin (BNB)`, `Bitcoin (BTC)`` (primary), `BTCUSDTUSDT` (secondary)
- **Avoidance:** `Low-volume altcoins` (liquidity risk during volatility), `Stablecoins`

## Timeframes

- **Analysis:** `1d` (identify key levels and setup before events)
- **Entry:** `15m` (time breakout entries precisely)
- **Monitoring:** `5m` (manage positions during high-volatility event periods)

## Edge & Philosophy

**Trading Edge:** `Volatility capture around predictable catalysts` - markets overreact to news, creating exploitable momentum in both directions. Event-driven moves have statistical edge due to information flow and behavioral finance (herding, FOMO).

**Market Philosophy:** "Markets are efficient in the long run, but highly inefficient around events. The biggest money is made in the chaos of catalyst-driven volatility. Wait for the setup, strike hard, exit before reversion."

**Strengths:**
- Identifying high-conviction catalysts before they fully price in
- Executing quickly under pressure during volatile periods
- Scaling out of winners at optimal levels
- Recognizing fake patterns vs. real breakouts

**Psychology:** `Thrives on chaos` - comfortable making rapid decisions when others are paralyzed. No emotional attachment to positions - quick to cut losses and take profits. Views each event as independent probability game.

## Example Trade

**Setup:** BNB announcement of major Binance ecosystem upgrade scheduled for 14:00 UTC. BNB consolidating at $320 resistance for 3 days.

**Analysis:** Historically BNB pumps 15-30% on ecosystem news. Price at key breakout level. Funding rates neutral (not crowded). Social sentiment rising.

**Entry:**
- 13:55 - Enter 50% position at $318 (anticipation)
- 14:05 - News released, price breaks $325 with volume
- Add 50% at $330 (momentum confirmation)
- Average entry: $324, 5x leverage

**Exit:**
- 14:45 - Price hits $385 (+19%), sell 50% position
- 16:30 - Price hits $412 (+27%), trail stop at $395
- 18:00 - Stop hit at $395, exit remainder

**Result:** +21.6% overall return in 4 hours. Captured initial spike and most of follow-through before exhaustion.

## Performance Notes

**Expected Performance:**
- Win rate: 45-55% (event trading is probabilistic, not high win rate)
- Average win: +25%
- Average loss: -10%
- Expect 2-3 big winners per month that carry performance

**Historical Edge:**
- BNB ecosystem events historically produce 15-40% moves
- BTC halving/ETF events produce similar volatility
- Key is patience - only trade A+ setups

**Drawdown Management:**
- Accepts 30-40% drawdowns during event drought
- Makes it back on 2-3 major event wins
- Sits out during unclear market conditions
