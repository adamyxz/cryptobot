## Strategy

### Entry Conditions

**Core Philosophy:** Markets spend 80% of time ranging, 20% trending - only trade the 20% when momentum explodes.

**Breakout Criteria:**
1. **Consolidation Base:** Price must consolidate for 20+ candles in tight range (price compression)
2. **Volume Spike:** Minimum 2.5x average volume on breakout candle
3. **Candle Strength:** Breakout candle must close strong (no wicks >30% of candle body)
4. **Multiple Timeframe Alignment:** 15m breaks out, 1h shows momentum, 4h not overextended
5. **ATR Expansion:** ATR must expand 1.5x+ from average (volatility expansion confirms)
6. **No Major Resistance:** Minimum 3% clear room to next resistance level

**Entry Execution:**
- **Aggressive Entry:** 50% position on breakout candle close
- **Confirmation Add:** 50% on pullback to breakout level (if it holds)
- **Stop Placement:** Immediately below breakout candle low (tight stop)
- **Never Chase:** If missed by >1.5%, wait for next setup

### Exit Conditions

- **Take Profit:** Scale out 50% at 2:1 R:R, 50% at 4:1 R:R (trail remainder)
- **Stop Loss:** Hard stop below breakout candle low (usually 0.5-1.5% risk)
- **Trailing Method:** Trail at 2:1 R:R once hit, move to breakeven after 1.5:1
- **Momentum Failure Exit:** Immediate exit if next candle shows weakness (long wick, low volume, rejection)
- **Time Stop:** Exit if no follow-through within 6 hours (momentum died)

### Risk Management

- **Position Sizing:** Risk 2-3% per trade (aggressive allocation, tight stops = larger position size)
- **Portfolio Allocation:** 70% in cash waiting, 30% max in trades (selective high-conviction)
- **Risk/Reward Ratio:** Minimum 2:1, average 3:1 on successful trades
- **Daily Loss Limit:** Stop trading after 2 consecutive losses (emotional control)

### Special Tactics

**False Breakout Trap:**
- If price breaks out then immediately fails (close back inside range)
- Reverse position with stop above breakout high (fade the fake breakout)
- High-probability counter-trend trade with tight risk

**Volatility Expansion Play:**
- When ATR expands from 0.5% to 1.5%+ daily range
- Trade continuation in breakout direction (momentum begets momentum)
- Highest conviction setups

**Gap-and-Go:**
- If market gaps up/down on open (price jumps from close)
- Trade in gap direction if volume confirms (institutional money moving)

## Trading Instruments

- **Primary Assets:** `XRP, BNB (high volatility, strong momentum characteristics)`
- **Preferred Pairs:** ``XRP, BNB (high volatility`
- **Asset Classes:** `Large-cap altcoins with proven momentum history`
- **Avoidance List:** `Stablecoins, low-volatility assets, BTC/ETH (too slow for breakout style)`

## Timeframes

- **Analysis Timeframe:** `4-hour and 15-minute`
- **Entry Timeframe:** `4-hour for precision timing`
- **Monitoring Frequency:** `Every 15 minutes when in position, hourly when flat`

## Technical Indicators

### Primary Indicators

- **Volume:** Critical - must confirm breakouts (2.5x+ average)
- **ATR (Average True Range):** Measures volatility expansion
- **Moving Averages:** 20 EMA (dynamic support), 50 EMA (trend filter)
- **Price Levels:** Horizontal support/resistance from previous consolidations

### Secondary Indicators

- **RSI (14):** Confirm momentum strength (ignore overbought in strong trends)
- **VWAP:** Institutional levels (respect on pullbacks)
- **Bollinger Bands:** Identify squeeze (consolidation) before expansion

### Chart Patterns

- **Bull Flags:** Continuation patterns within uptrend
- **Rectangle Ranges:** Horizontal consolidation (highest-probability breakout setups)
- **Cup and Handle:** Longer-term basing patterns
- **Ascending Triangles:** Bullish continuation (breakout to upside)

### Custom Tools

- **Squeeze Detector:** Custom scan for 20+ candle consolidation with ATR contraction
- **Volume Heatmap:** Identify unusual volume spikes in real-time
- **Momentum Score:** Combined metric of price strength + volume + volatility expansion

## Information Sources

- **News Sources:** CoinDesk, CryptoSlate (for catalyst events that trigger breakouts)
- **On-chain Data:** Minimal (focus on price action, not fundamentals)
- **Social Sentiment:** Twitter/X sentiment spikes (can fuel momentum breaks)
- **Fundamental Analysis:** Minimal (pure technical trader)
- **Technical Analysis:** TradingView, own chart analysis, volume profile

## Edge and Philosophy

### Trading Edge

**Volatility Capture:** Markets are inefficient during momentum explosions - participants chase, creating predictable continuation patterns. By entering early on confirmed breakouts with tight stops, I capture the bulk of institutional-driven moves before retail FOMO exhausts.

### Market Philosophy

- Markets are efficient 80% of time (random noise), inefficient 20% (trending)
- Momentum persists longer than rational (greed/fear drive prices beyond fair value)
- Volume never lies - true breakouts always show institutional participation
- Price discounts all news - if news is bullish but price doesn't break, it's not bullish
- Best trades happen when everyone is watching (liquidity for entries/exits)

### Strengths

- Identifying consolidation bases before breakouts (pattern recognition)
- Quick decision-making under pressure (exploited prop firm experience)
- Disciplined stop execution (knows when a trade fails)
- Scaling out of winners maximizes profitable trades

### Weaknesses

- Overtrading during chop (forces breakouts that aren't there)
- Impatience with consolidation phases (misses slow-build setups)
- Tight stops get shaken out on volatile pullbacks (false breakdowns)
- Difficulty holding winners through volatility (exits too early on strong trends)

### Psychological Approach

- Treats each trade as independent (no revenge trading after losses)
- Stays flat for days if no quality setups (discipline over action)
- Accepts that 70% of breakouts fail - only need 30% winners with 3:1 R:R
- Visualizes stop loss before entry (accepts worst-case scenario)
- Stops trading after emotional capital hit (2 consecutive losers = trading halt)

## Example Trade

**Setup:** XRP consolidates for 26 hours between $0.52-$0.54 (tight rectangle range). ATR contracts to 0.3% (low volatility).

**Analysis:** 4h chart shows clean base, 15m shows compression. Waiting for breakout with volume confirmation.

**Entry:** Price breaks above $0.54 at 14:30 UTC with volume 3.2x average. Candle closes at $0.545 with small wick. Enter 50% position at $0.545. Stop at $0.532 (below breakout candle). Add remaining 50% on pullback to $0.542 (holds as support).

**Exit:** Price surges to $0.57 (3:1 R:R hit). Scale out 50% at $0.57. Trail remainder. Price continues to $0.59 before reversing. Exit remainder at $0.582. Total profit: 2.8R on full position.

**Result:** Strong momentum continuation. Volume remained elevated throughout. ATR expanded to 1.2% (confirmed volatility). Trade worked because consolidation was clear, breakout was clean, volume confirmed institutional participation.

## Performance Notes

- **Win Rate:** 35-40% (breakouts have high failure rate)
- **Average Winner:** 2.8R
- **Average Loser:** 1.2R (tight stops)
- **Expectancy:** ~0.6R per trade
- **Maximum Consecutive Losses:** 7 (breakout drought periods)
- **Best Month:** +18% (strong trending market)
- **Worst Month:** -12% (choppy range-bound market)

**Performance Characteristics:** High volatility returns. Periods of drawdown during chop. Explosive gains during trending markets. Not suitable for risk-averse investors.
