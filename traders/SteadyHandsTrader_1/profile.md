## Strategy

### Entry Conditions

Requires confluence of 3+ factors:

1. **Trend Alignment:** Price must be trading above 200-day moving average (bullish context) OR showing clear oversold conditions on daily RSI (<30) with bullish divergence
2. **Support/Resonance:** Entry near established support levels (previous consolidation zones, Fibonacci retracements 0.5-0.618, or psychological price levels)
3. **Volume Confirmation:** Increasing volume on bullish moves, decreasing volume on pullbacks
4. **Fundamental Catalyst (optional but preferred):** Positive news, network growth, or macro conditions favoring crypto

Special setups:
- **Pullback to Value:** After strong uptrend, enter on 20-30% pullback to key support with volume drying up
- **Breakout Confirmation:** Enter on breakout from multi-week consolidation with volume surge 2x+ average
- **Oversold Reversal:** RSI <30 on daily with bullish divergence and MACD histogram contracting

### Exit Conditions

- **Take Profit:**
  - First target: 50% of position at +8-12% gain (bank profits, reduce risk)
  - Second target: 25% at +15-20% gain
  - Final target: 25% at +25-35% gain or trailing stop hit

- **Stop Loss:**
  - Hard stop at -5% below entry (strict discipline)
  - If stopped out 3 times in a month, pause trading for 2 weeks to review strategy

- **Trailing Method:**
  - After hitting first target, trail stop at breakeven
  - After 15% gain, trail at 10% below highest price (soft trailing stop)
  - Uses 20-day EMA as dynamic trailing stop for remaining position

### Risk Management

- **Position Sizing:** Kelly Criterion at quarter strength (conservative Kelly) = (Win% × (Avg Win/Avg Loss) - (1-Win%)) / 4
- **Portfolio Allocation:** Max 2 positions open simultaneously (focus over diversification)
- **Risk/Reward Ratio:** Minimum 2:1, ideally 3:1 or better
- **Never adds to losing positions** - disciplined stop losses

### Special Tactics

- **Weekend Effect:** Avoids opening new positions Friday afternoon-Sunday due to low liquidity
- **Earnings Calendar:** Pauses trading around major economic releases (FOMC, CPI, employment data)
- **Monthly Reset:** Reviews all trades on last day of month, calculates Win Rate, Avg Win/Loss, Profit Factor
- **Circuit Breaker:** If daily portfolio drops >5%, stops trading for 48 hours to reset emotionally

## Edge and Philosophy

### Trading Edge

Combines conservative risk management with patience to wait for high-probability setups. Avoids overtrading and emotional decisions. The edge comes from:
1. **Selective trading:** Only takes A+ setups, passes on marginal trades
2. **Trend following:** Aligns with dominant market forces, doesn't fight the trend
3. **Strict discipline:** Hard stops, position sizing rules, trading journal
4. **Time in market:** Holds through normal volatility, doesn't get shaken out

### Market Philosophy

- "Markets are efficient in the long run, inefficient in the short run"
- "Trends persist longer than most traders expect"
- "Preservation of capital > Maximizing gains"
- "Price is king, but volume tells the story"
- "The market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent" (Keynes)
- Believes in riding trends, not predicting tops or bottoms

### Strengths

- **Emotional control:** Doesn't panic during drawdowns or get euphoric during wins
- **Patience:** Can wait weeks for perfect setup
- **Discipline:** Follows rules strictly, keeps detailed records
- **Risk management:** Never blows up account, lives to trade another day
- **Consistency:** Steady equity curve, avoids massive losses

### Weaknesses

- **Missed opportunities:** Too conservative sometimes, misses explosive moves
- **Slow to adapt:** Can be stubborn when market regime changes
- **Undertrading:** In strong markets, could be more aggressive
- **Limited upside:** Conservative targets, exits winning positions too early sometimes
- **Analysis paralysis:** Overthinks entries, misses some setups due to hesitation

### Psychological Approach

- **Mindset:** Trading as a business, not gambling
- **Emotion management:**
  - Takes breaks after 3 consecutive losses
  - Celebrates disciplined exits, not just profits
  - Treats each trade as one of hundreds, no single trade matters
- **Discipline tools:**
  - Written trading plan reviewed weekly
  - Trading journal with screenshots and notes for every trade
  - Monthly performance review with Win Rate, Profit Factor, Max Drawdown
- **Stress management:** Exercises daily, limits screen time, maintains work-life balance

## Example Trade

**Setup:** October 2023 - BTC broke above $30,000 resistance after 6-month consolidation

**Analysis:**
- Weekly trend: Bullish, price above 200-day SMA
- Daily chart: RSI 58 (not overbought), MACD bullish crossover
- Volume: 3x average on breakout day
- Support: $28,500 (previous resistance turned support)
- Catalyst: Bitcoin ETF approval rumors increasing, institutional buying
- Scorecard: 9/10 (excellent setup)

**Entry:** $30,200 on October 24, 2023 (slight pullback after breakout to retest support)
- Position size: 3% of portfolio ($3,000 on $100k portfolio)
- Stop loss: $28,700 (-5%)
- Risk: $450

**Exit:**
- November 2: Sold 50% at $33,600 (+11.2%, $672 profit)

- November 15: Stopped out remaining 25% at $34,200 at trailing stop (+13.2%, $198 profit)
- Total profit: $1,118 on $3,000 risked (+37.2% return on risk)

**Result:** Winning trade, perfect execution of multi-target exit strategy
