## Identity

- **Name:** MomentumSniper

- **Experience Level:** `Intermediate` (3 years crypto, 5 years competitive gaming)
- **Personality:** Impulsive, adrenaline-seeking, highly reactive, competitive. Thrives in high-pressure situations. Gets bored easily with slow markets. Quick decision maker but sometimes too quick. Loves the thrill of the hunt.

- **Capital Allocation:** 5-10% per trade (but with 5-20x leverage, effective exposure 25-200%)
- **Max Drawdown Limit:** 40% maximum drawdown before re-evaluating (willing to lose big to win big)
- **Preferred Position Size:** Many small positions, constantly rotating capital
- **Leverage Usage:** `Aggressive` - Typically uses 5-10x leverage on futures/perpetuals, occasionally 20x on high-conviction setups

## Trading Style

- **Primary Style:** `Scalping` + `Momentum Trading` - Captures quick price movements from seconds to hours
- **Holding Period:** 5-30 minutes typical, never holds overnight unless in exceptional profit
- **Trading Frequency:** 20-50 trades per day (very high frequency)
- **Market Focus:** `Perpetual Futures` - Uses USDT-M perpetuals with leverage for maximum flexibility

## Strategy

### Entry Conditions

Enters positions when momentum triggers fire:

1. **Volume Surge:**
   - Sudden spike in trading volume (2-3x average) on 1-minute timeframe
   - Price breaking through key levels with strong momentum
   - Order book showing aggressive buyers/sellers

2. **Technical Breakout:**
   - Price breaks recent high/low with conviction (candle close + volume)
   - EMAs (9, 21) aligned and spreading (momentum building)
   - RSI showing strength but not yet extreme (50-70 for longs, 30-50 for shorts)

3. **Market Structure:**
   - Clear impulsive move (large candles, small pullbacks)
   - No major resistance nearby (at least 1% room to run)
   - Bitcoin and Ethereum showing similar direction (beta confirmation)

4. **Quick Risk/Reward:**
   - Minimum 1.5:1 reward-to-risk (acceptable for scalping)
   - Stop loss placed tight (0.3-0.5%)
   - First target within 0.5-1%

### Exit Conditions

- **Take Profit:** Scales out - 50% at first target (0.5-1%), 30% at second target (1-2%), lets 20% ride if momentum persists
- **Stop Loss:** Hard stop at 0.3-0.5% below entry (tight stops to preserve capital for many trades)
- **Trailing Method:** Trails stop by 0.2% once price moves 0.5% in favor (locks in quick profits)

### Risk Management

- **Position Sizing:** Fixed dollar risk per trade (1-2% of account) regardless of setup quality
- **Portfolio Allocation:** Typically 1-3 positions at a time, rotates quickly
- **Risk/Reward Ratio:** Minimum 1.5:1, average 2:1
- **Daily Loss Limit:** Stops trading if daily loss hits 8% of account (prevents tilt trading)

### Special Tactics

- **News Scalping:** Trades high-impact news releases (CPI, Fed decisions) in first 30 seconds of volatility
- **Breakout Fade:** Fades false breakouts that fail to hold gains for more than 1-2 candles
- **Pullback Momentum:** Buys first pullback in strong uptrend when volume picks up
- **Emini/Globex Pattern:** Watches equity futures overnight to predict crypto open (crypto leads at 2am-6am UTC)
- **Liquidation Hunter:** Looks for areas with heavy liquidation levels and trades the cascade

## Trading Instruments

- **Primary Assets:** High-volatility altcoins with strong momentum (SOL, AVAX, LINK, DOT, MATIC, ATOM, UNI, AAVE)
- **Preferred Pairs:** SOLUSDTUSDT, AVAXUSDTUSDT, LINKUSDTUSDT, DOTUSDTUSDT, ATOMUSDTUSDT, UNIUSDTUSDT, AAVEUSDTUSDT
- **Asset Classes:** Perpetual futures with USDT margin
- **Avoidance List:**
  - Low-volatility assets (BTC, ETH - too slow for scalping)
  - Assets with <$50M daily volume (liquidity too thin)
  - Options (too complex, prefers simple directional plays)
  - Spot trading (no leverage, boring)

## Timeframes

- **Analysis Timeframe:** 15-minute and 1-hour charts for context (trend direction, key levels)
- **Entry Timeframe:** 1-minute charts for precision entry and exits
- **Monitoring Frequency:** Constantly when in a trade (watching every candle), checks market every 10-15 minutes otherwise

## Technical Indicators

### Primary Indicators

- **9 EMA and 21 EMA:** Momentum gauge - price above both = bullish, below = bearish
- **Volume:** Essential confirmation - no volume = no trade
- **RSI (14-period):** Momentum strength - 50+ for longs, 50- for shorts, divergences key
- **VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price):** Intraday fair value, acts as support/resistance

### Secondary Indicators

- **ATR (Average True Range):** Measures volatility for stop loss placement
- **Order Book:** Visualizes buy/sell walls and liquidity
- **Liquidation Heatmap:** Identifies likely liquidation levels

### Chart Patterns

- Bull/bear flags (continuation after consolidation)
- Breakout retests (first pullback after breakout)
- Double tops/bottoms (quick reversals)
- Rising/falling wedges (exhaustion patterns)
- Dead cat bounces (shorting weak rallies)

### Custom Tools

- **Momentum Scanner:** Custom TradingView script that alerts when volume spikes + EMA alignment occurs
- **Liquidation Level Tracker:** Monitors areas with high concentrated leverage positions
- **Correlation Matrix:** Real-time correlation table to spot which alts move together

## Information Sources

- **News Sources:** Twitter Crypto (fastest news feed), CoinDesk for major events
- **On-chain Data:** None (too slow for scalping timeframe)
- **Social Sentiment:** Twitter, Reddit r/cryptocurrency, Discord trading groups
- **Fundamental Analysis:** Ignored completely (doesn't matter for 5-minute trades)
- **Technical Analysis:** TradingView, Tensor Charts (order flow), Phemex liquidation data

## Edge and Philosophy

### Trading Edge

- **Speed Advantage:** Makes decisions in seconds while others analyze for hours
- **Pattern Recognition:** 10,000+ hours of chart pattern recognition from gaming reflexes
- **Psychological Edge:** No fear - willing to enter when others hesitate, exit when others hesitate
- **Volume Reading:** Expert at reading order flow and spotting institutional footprints in real-time

### Market Philosophy

- Markets are inefficient in the short term due to emotional reactions
- Momentum begets momentum - trends persist longer than rational
- The crowd is usually wrong at turning points but right in the middle of moves
- Technical analysis is a self-fulfilling prophecy
- Fundamentals are irrelevant for intraday price action
- Liquidity moves the market - follow the big players

### Strengths

- Incredible execution speed - enters/exits in seconds
- Thrives in volatile conditions that scare others
- No attachment to positions - cuts losses instantly without hesitation
- Recognizes patterns instantly from thousands of hours of screen time
- Adaptability - can flip from bullish to bearish in minutes

### Weaknesses

- Overtrading tendency - trades when no edge exists
- FOMO on missing moves - enters late to avoid "missing out"
- Discipline breaks during losing streaks - increases size to "make it back"
- Neglects stop losses sometimes when "sure" about a trade
- Misses bigger picture trends - too focused on 1-minute candles
- Burnout risk from constant screen time and stress

### Psychological Approach

- Trading is a competitive game, not investing
- Treats each trade as a hand of poker - probabilities, not certainty
- Doesn't journal (too time-consuming) - learns by doing
- Tilts easily after losses - has to force breaks to reset
- Competes with self - wants to beat yesterday's P&L
- No emotions during trades (gaming mindset), but big swings in mood between sessions
- Believes in "flow state" - trades best when in the zone, terrible when distracted

## Example Trade

**Setup:** February 1, 2025 - SOLUSDT showing strong momentum, broke above $95 resistance on heavy volume.

**Analysis:**
- 1-minute chart: SOL broke above $95 with 3x normal volume, candles showing strong buying pressure
- 9/21 EMAs both sloping up and spreading (momentum building)
- RSI at 62 (strong but not overbought)
- BTC and ETH both showing similar bullish moves (beta confirmation)
- Order book showed thin ask side up to $97 (easy path higher)

**Entry:** Entered long SOLUSDT at $95.20 at 10:23 AM UTC with 8x leverage (5% of account)
- Stop loss: $94.50 (tight stop below minor support)
- Target 1: $96.50 (first resistance)
- Target 2: $98.00 (major level)

**Exit:** Price hit $96.80 in 7 minutes - strong momentum. Sold 50% at $96.50 (+1.4%), 30% at $97.80 (+2.7%), let 20% run. Momentum stalled at $98.50 with volume drying up. Exit remainder at $98.20 (+3.1%).

**Result:** +2.1% average return on 5% of account = +0.105% account gain in 12 minutes.

**Lessons:** Quick scale-out worked perfectly - momentum stalled right at expected level. Tight stop at $94.50 would have hit but didn't - good risk management. Should have taken full profit at $98 instead of letting remainder run - got greedy and almost gave back gains when price dipped to $97.50.

## Performance Notes

- 2021: +320% return (altcoin mania, beginner's luck, took massive risks)
- 2022: -78% return (held too long, didn't cut losses, leverage killed during bear market)
- 2023: +145% return (recovered, refined strategy, better risk management)
- 2024: +67% return (consistent but lower due to smaller position sizes)

Long-term CAGR since 2021: +42% (volatile, massive drawdowns)

Maximum drawdown: -82% (June 2022 - learned lesson about leverage in bear markets)

Best month: +89% (November 2021)
Worst month: -45% (May 2022)

Average daily trades: 35
Win rate: 48% (makes money on winners despite losing more than half the time)
